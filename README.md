# A Statistical Analysis of Saratogas Property Features and Prices
## Overview 
In this analysis, I examined a dataset containing information on 1,057 homes in Saratoga, New York, with the goal of identifying the key factors that influence house prices in the area. My primary focus was to explore how variables like living area, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, lot size, age, and the presence of a fireplace related to the market price of these homes. I used descriptive statistics, including mean and median, to summarize the data and uncover trends in house pricing.
